Hebrew University of Jerusalem has a course on Coursera which is divided in
2 parts, but I found it free on youtube.</br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDd_kMiAuNmSb-CKWQqq9oBFN_KNMTaI">First part</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrDd_kMiAuNmllp9vuPqCuttC1XL9VyVh">Second part</a></br>

There is also a book in source code, however, there is first and second edition, I personally prefer second as it is more textually readable.</br>

On top there is software folder, which you can download and open any program which is provided by nand2tetris course,
but do not forget to download JDK first if you don't have it already.</br>

Good luck!
