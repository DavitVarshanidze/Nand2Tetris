# ðŸ§  Nand2Tetris â€“ From NAND Gate to Tetris

This repository contains my full implementation of the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. The goal of the course is to build a complete computer system from the ground up â€” starting from basic logic gates and ending with a fully functioning OS and Tetris game written in a high-level language.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

Nand2Tetris is split into two parts:

### Part I â€“ Hardware
- Logic gates (NAND, AND, OR, etc.)
- ALU and registers
- RAM, Program Counter, Memory
- Hack CPU and overall computer architecture

### Part II â€“ Software
- Assembler
- Virtual Machine (VM) translator
- Jack language (compiler)
- Operating system (OS) built in Jack
- Projects like Pong and Tetris
